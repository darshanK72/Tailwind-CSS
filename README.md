# Learning Tailwind CSS

Welcome to my repository for learning Tailwind CSS! In this repository, you'll find resources, examples, and exercises related to mastering Tailwind CSS.

## About Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation, Tailwind CSS doesn't come with predefined components. Instead, it provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.
